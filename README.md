# 🗂️ Mini File Manager API (Built with Node.js)

A simple backend API built using **Node.js core modules** — no frameworks — that allows you to **create**, **read**, and **delete** text files directly through the browser.

This project was built as part of a **Problem-Based Learning (PBL)** approach to understand how servers, file systems, and routing work inside Node.js.
